# Description #

The IOFlashControlerUserClient class allows access to the NAND driver from userland.

The kIOFlashControllerReadPage selector can be used to read NAND pages + spare area. On iOS 3 it is possible to read the full spare area (metadata+ECC), this does not seem to be possible starting with iOS 4, only the (12) metadata bytes are read.

All selectors were removed in iOS 5, except kIOFlashControllerDisableKeepout and kIOFlashControllerUpdateFirmware.
